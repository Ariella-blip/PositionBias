# Position Bias

This repository consists of three notebooks:

- RealData.ipynb: In this notebook, the preprocessing steps used for the real data of NVB are shown. Everything is anonymized.
- Simulations.ipynb: In this notebook the code for all the simulations used in this report is shown. In total there where 4 simulations: simulations with and without rank-relevance correlation and uniform and non-uniform sparse simulations.
- Algorithm.ipynb: In this notebook, the algorithm used is shown: the EM algorithm with and without priors and additionally the baseline.
